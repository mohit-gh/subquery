A Subquery is simply a select statement, that returns a single value and can be nested inside a SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE, OR DELETE
STATEMENT. It is also possible to nest a subquery inside another subquery. According to MSDN, subqueries can be nested upto 
32 levels.

Subqueries are always enclosed in paranthesis and are also called as inner queries, and the query containing the subquery is called
as outer query. The columns from a table that is present only inside a subquery, cannot be used in the SELECT list of the 
outer query.
